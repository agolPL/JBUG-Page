<h1>Homework: Homework 4.1</h1>
<p>In this week’s homework we will create a replica set and add some
	data to it. 1. Download week4.js from the Download Handout link. 2. We
	will create a three member replica set. Pick a root working directory
	to work in. Go to that directory in a console window. Given we will
	have three members in the set, and three mongod processes, create three
	data directories: mkdir 1 mkdir 2 mkdir 3 3. We will now start a single
	mongod as a standalone server. Given we will have three mongod
	processes on our single test server, we will explicitly specify the
	port numbers (this wouldn’t be necessary if we had three real machines
	or three virtual machines). We’ll also use the --smallfiles parameter
	and --oplogSize so the files are small given we have a lot of server
	processes running on our test PC. # starting as a standalone server for
	problem 1: mongod --dbpath 1 --port 27001 --smallfiles --oplogSize 50
	Note: for all mongod startups in the homework this week, you can
	optionally use --logPath, --logAppend, and --fork. Or, since this is
	just an exercise on a local PC, you could simply have a separate
	terminal window for all and forgo those settings. Run “mongod --help”
	for more info on those. 4. In a separate terminal window (cmd.exe on
	Windows), run the mongo shell with the week4.js file: mongo --port
	27001 --shell week4.js Then run in the shell: > homework.init() This
	will load a small amount of test data into the database. Now run</p>

<h1>Homework: Homework 4.2</h1>
<p>Now convert the mongod instance (the one in the problem 4.1
	above, which uses “--dbpath 1”) to a single server replica set. To do
	this, you’ll need to stop the mongod and restart it with “--replSet” on
	its command line. Give the set any name you like. Then go to the mongo
	shell. You should see some data in the week4 database. You can confirm
	with: > use week4 > db.foo.find() Once done with that run >
	homework.b() in the mongo shell and enter that result.</p>
	
<h1>Homework: Homework 4.3</h1>
<p>Now convert the mongod instance (the one in the problem 4.1
	above, which uses “--dbpath 1”) to a single server replica set. To do
	this, you’ll need to stop the mongod and restart it with “--replSet” on
	its command line. Give the set any name you like. Then go to the mongo
	shell. You should see some data in the week4 database. You can confirm
	with: > use week4 > db.foo.find() Once done with that run >
	homework.b() in the mongo shell and enter that result.</p>
